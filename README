Steps for student (Steps 1-3 are first time only):

Setting up:
1. Get a github account
2. Set up git (Documentation on github.com) At the end of this, you should be able to authenticate with github doing ssh git@github.com
3. Fork the hackerdojoml/mrbigdata.git repository (http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/)

Making changes:
4. Make your changes (only in the relevant directories: below)
5. cd <top_of_tree>; git add *
6. git commit -am '<Commit mssg>'
7. git push origin master (at this point, you should be able to see the changes on github.com/<username>/repo)
8. Send pull request to hackerdojoml (http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)

To pull in upstream changes:
1. git remote add upstream git://github.com/hackerdojoml/mrbigdata.git   <Only the first time>
2. git fetch upstream
3. git merge upstream/master

NOTE: You only have to do this if you want to contribute directly to hackerdojoml, a much better model is if each group collaborates with each other and elects a leader who collaborates with hackerdojoml, but its a little more complicated, and I am _not_ writing the instructions for that :) 

Steps for teacher:

To add files:
1. cd <relevant_dir>;
2. Make changes, including adding, copying, modifying files)
3. cd <top_of_branch>;  (ls >> src,README)
4. git add *
5. git commit -am '<Commit mssg>'
6. git push origin master
7. <Optional> Send pull request(http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) 


To get other people's homework submissions:
1. Sign in as hackerdojoml
2. Go to https://github.com/hackerdojoml/mrbigdata/pulls
3. Pull in all the changes (eg, if you see a request from debnathsinha, do...)
3.1 git remote add debnathsinha git://github.com/hackerdojoml/mrbigdata.git    <first time only>
3.2 git fetch debnathsinha
3.3 git merge debnathsinha/master
4. Close the pull request



Directory structure:
To avoid conflicts in merges, we should work the class stuff off different dirs:

src/classes/class<n> : source code for class work (only Tricia/Mike write into this)
src/homeworks/group<m>/week<k> : Source code for homework submissions
src/homeworks/group<m>/<username> : scratch space for <username>
